We willl be creating a basic reporting app in Flask for an organization that simply needs to display its database information onto a browser page so that staff in different cities can view it.

(1) Create a new Postgres database that stores Members (firstname, lastname, email, password) and Events (name, date, city, attendance count). 

(2) Add 10 sample data points to each table using the command line.

(3) Create a Flask app that has only two views: one to display all of the Members and one to display all of the Events

(4) Complete the parts you know how to do and take note of the parts where you get stuck. We will spent the first 30 minutes of instruction time going over these points.
